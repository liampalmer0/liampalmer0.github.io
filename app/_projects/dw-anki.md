desc: Python CLI app that adds Deutsche Welle German course vocab to Anki
---

A simple CLI application to help me streamline the creation of German vocabulary decks.

Uses vocabulary words from Deutsche Welle's free online German courses along with a Python library `genanki` to create word pairs in a memorization app called Anki.
