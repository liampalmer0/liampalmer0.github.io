Money Man is a money management desktop app made with Electon and React.

This project started out as a simple net income calculator for hourly workers and only used pure JavaScript and Electron. I decided to overhaul the project during the first few months of 2021 by switching to React and building out some more features.

The project is still under development but most of the basic features are present and working.
