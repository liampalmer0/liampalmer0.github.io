A configurable outfit recommendation web app. Uses local weather, calendar events and a list of clothes to generate outfits. FOTD is based loosely on the computerized closet from the 1995 movie *Clueless*. 

The site was built with Node.js and the web framework Express.js. PostgreSQL was used for persistence and an ORM called Sequelize was used to interact with the data.

Some of the final features included:
* CRUD operations for clothing items
* Outfit recommendations
* Sign up/login using Passport.js
* Fully functional built in calendar
* Configurable weather display with geolocation support

This project was my undergraduate senior design project and was completed over 8 months in a team of three. My role was lead/full stack developer, technical architect, and project manager.
