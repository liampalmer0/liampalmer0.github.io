My own small collection of art made with CSS. Inspired by Lynn Fisher's [A Single Div](https://a.singlediv.com/).

When I saw Lynn Fisher's work I thought I would try my hand at both single div and multi-div CSS art. This project has been a bit of an experiment but also a fantastic learning experience.

Who would have thought a bunch of overlapping gradients could look so good?
